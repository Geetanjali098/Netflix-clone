# Netflix Clone with React and Firebase

This Netflix clone application built with React, Redux, and Firebase.
The application mimics Netflix's core functionality with movie browsing, categorized content, and a responsive UI.

## Key Features

1. **React-Redux Architecture**: 
   - Uses Redux for state management to handle movies and genres
   - Implements async actions with `fetchMovies` and `getGenres`

   - Custom styled components using `styled-components`
   - Responsive navigation bar (`TopNav`) that changes on scroll
   - Movie sliders (`SliderContainer`) for categorized content
   - Interactive buttons for playback and more information

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for component state and side effects
   - Scroll detection for UI effects
   - React Router integration for navigation
   - Firebase backend (implied by the Redux actions) for data storage

4. **Visual Design**:
   - Gradient text effects
   - Image brightness control for better text visibility
   - Responsive layout with absolute positioning
   - Custom button styling
